Explanation of Categories:,,,
,,,
"Regression – Predicts continuous values (e.g., house price prediction).",,,
"Classification – Predicts discrete classes (e.g., spam detection).",,,
Supervised Learning – Model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).,,,
Unsupervised Learning – Model finds patterns in data without labeled outputs.,,,
Reinforcement Learning – Model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.,,,
